# Industry Surveys

Bridge2Food's industry surveys, co-funded by the European Union, provide benchmark data for the sustainable food and protein sectors. Each quarter, we publish a series of key indicators, offering policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders valuable insight into the industry's status and outlook.
