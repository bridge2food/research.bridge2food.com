We enable the uptake of sustainable food innovations by delivering knowledge where it has the greatest impact.

We author comprehensive reports and produce insightful data visualisations. Leveraging the Bridge2Food network, we manage media communications and organise meetings, workshops, and events.

:::

The project's aim was to scale microalgae production and prepare the market for uptake of microalgae proteins as ingredients for innovative and sustainable food and feed products. Bringing together 31 partners across academia and industry, ProFuture was coordinated by the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA) in Spain. The final conference of ProFuture took place on 13th and 14th of September 2023 in Brussels.
