# Overview 
:::

The Microbial & Recombinant Food Producer (MRFP) Survey captures benchmark data from the microbial and recombinant food production sectors. It includes companies leveraging microorganisms such as fungi, algae, and bacteria, to produce ingredients through processes such as industrial fermentation, precision fermentation, and plant molecular farming.

Each quarter, the survey delivers valuable insights into the industryâ€™s status and outlook, providing essential information for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. For companies operating in the cell-cultured food sector, this survey is an indispensable tool offering empirical guidance for strategic business planning.

This survey is made possible through funding from the European Union's [HORIZON EUROPE](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en) research and innovation programme under grant agreement [No 101059632](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101059632/HORIZON).
