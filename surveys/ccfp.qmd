The Cell-Cultured Food Producer (CCFP) Survey captures benchmark data from the cell-cultured meat and dairy sectors. It includes producers of cell-cultured foods and ingredients as well as supporting technology, equipment, and input suppliers.

Each quarter, the survey delivers valuable insights into the industryâ€™s status and outlook, providing essential information for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. For companies operating in the cell-cultured food sector, this survey is an indispensable tool offering empirical guidance for strategic business planning.
