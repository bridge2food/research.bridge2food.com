Before we continue to the next questions, we would like to give you a few food definitions that are important to know for this survey:

-   **Legumes** are sources of Plant-Based **protein**, and include lentils, beans, soy, and chickpeas (dried, canned, frozen).

-   **Legume-Based foods** are made **solely** from the seeds of **legumes**\*, and include tofu, tempeh, falafel, hummus, and soy-based products.

-   **Plant-Based alternatives** are products made solely from Plant-Based ingredients and are developed to **resemble conventional animal-based foods** such as meat or dairy. (Examples include soy burgers and soy milk).

Which statement best describes how frequently you have consumed the following foods in the last 12 months?

::: {.card title="Prompt"}
Before we continue to the next question, please read carefully the following definitions:

For the purpose of this questionnaire, **Fermented Foods** are defined as "foods made through desired microbial growth and enzymatic conversions of food components". Fermented Foods are produced from diverse food substrates, such as vegetables, grains, soybean, milk, fish and meat. Fermented Foods often contain **live microorganisms**. Among those foods are yogurt, cheese and kombucha. However, in several Fermented Foods the microorganisms are not alive anymore, for example in bread, pasteurised fermented vegetables, soy sauce, and wine.

The **products made from plants** (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, beans, etc.) will be referred as "**Plant-Based Food**", while the **products made from fermentation on Plant-Based plant-based raw materials** will be referred as "**Plant-Based Fermented Food**".

Please indicate (with a cross or tick) how often do you consume the following fermented products present in the table, on a scale from "I do not recognize the product" to "I consume it 2 or more times a day".

Please evaluate the following statements about your attitudes towards Plant-Based Fermented Foods on a scale from "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree". Prior to evaluation, please read through the following definitions.

I would be willing to try a product that is prepared through:

**Traditional Fermentation** is the process of modifying food via **microbial activity**. This is how beer, wine, yogurt, and cheese are made. Traditional fermentation is used e.g. to **improve the flavor** or **functionality** of plant ingredients.

**Biomass Fermentation** is utilized within food industry to grow **protein-rich microorganisms**. These microorganisms are used as ingredients for plant-based alternative proteins. Alternative proteins are aimed to replace milk, meat, or fish as protein source. For example, filamentous fungi grown via fermentation can be used as the primary ingredient of alternative protein.

**Precision Fermentation** uses microorganisms to produce specific functional ingredients. The microorganisms are programmed to be little production factories. This is how insulin for diabetic patients is produced, as well as rennet for cheese production. Precision fermentation enables alternative protein producers to efficiently make specific proteins, enzymes, flavor molecules, vitamins, pigments, and fats.

# About

## Row

[HealthFerm](https://www.healthferm.eu/) is the EU-funded research project investigating innovative pulse and cereal-based food fermentations together with the health effects and consumer perception of novel fermented foods. Work Package 4 "Consumer Studies" has the following objectives:

-   To identify levers to promote the consumption of foods & meals based on plant-based fermentations.
-   To assess and monitor the changes in consumer perceptions towards plant-based fermented foods in 9 EU countries.

To achieve these objectives, two cross-sectional surveys are planned, aiming to explore consumer perceptions of plant-based fermented foods (PBFF). For this purpose, HealthFerm set up a questionnaire that addressed attitudes, trust, behaviour, and market opportunities for fermented plant-based foods. The questionnaire included socio-demographic information that will allow for segmenting and statistical modelling.

This report is based on the first wave that took place between December 2023 and February 2024 across BE, CH, DE, DK, FI, FR, IT, RO, SE. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, locality of residence, education level, financial situation, and dietary habits), to ensure representativeness, sufficient statistical power, and to further control for known confounding.

The survey was completed by respondents who were recruited by Enkettfabriken, with a total of 7,812 participants over the age of 18 and at least 750 respondents per country, equally divided amongst females/males (50% each), and within five age groups: 18-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60 and 60+ (approx. 20% in each).

Participants provided information about their eating habits, although only self-identified flexitarians and omnivores were asked about their consumption of meat, and their intentions towards reducing or increasing their currents consumption levels.
